		<h2>Wang studies communication dynamics and structures with respect to human sociality and organizing.</h2>
	</header>
	
	  <p>My research takes a relational and micro-sociological approach. I address communication dynamics and structures that lead to the emergence of fundamental properties about human sociality and organizing at multiple levels. I also look closely at interdependences between technological and social processes, embodied in communication behaviors.</p><p>Specially, I study emergent solidarity and hierarchy in relationships and groups, with a focus on communication and affective mechanisms that coexist and interplay with rational accounts. I have been studying information sharing and exchange structures in communities, communicative action and group emotion expressed by online &lsquo;crowds,&rsquo; and linguistic dynamics and status development in teams. My dissertation project further examines interpersonal processes of affect and communication during status organizing in task-oriented groups. In addition, I am enthusiastic about quantitative and computational methods, which are essential to my analytical view of social and communication dynamic and structure.</p>

			<h3>Communication, &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; &amp; Status Development</h3>
			<p>[<strong>Dissertation Project</strong>] The study investigates status development in collaborative decision-making groups that involve potential status contest. The focus is the following mediation: Visual status signaling leads to physiological stress responses, which in turn affects deference and status development. The goal of this study is to identify an affective mechanism (i.e., stress experience) of status development in task- and collective-oriented groups. Status development in such groups has been predominantly studied from a perspective that emphasizes group processes and judgment of task-specific competence or value to a group. &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; on the other hand, has been studied in relation to social status in human and primate groups, but not systematically examined in task- and collective-oriented settings that also involve status hierarchy. The present study attempts to address this issue.</p>

			<h3>&lsquo;Group Talk,&rsquo; Emotions, &amp; Self-Organized Solidarity</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//blogs.cornell.edu/margolin/people">Dr. Margolin</a>] The communication logics that spur self-organized collective action are not well-understood. We argue that two evolutionary predispositions—human group-mindedness and social functionalities of discrete emotions—contribute to a phenomenon we call &lsquo;group talk&rsquo; where group identifiers outwardly discuss their group and, by doing so, increase self-organized solidarity. We test this communication logic among professional football fans who are repeatedly exposed to intergroup competition outcomes that, for them, are quasi-randomized. We find that competition outcomes induce differential expressions of emotions in group talk, which stimulate (positivity, anger) or suppress (sadness) further group talk, triggering a self-sustaining tendency over a full week. Implications are discussed regarding group talk’s socio-emotional functionality for self-organization in contemporary collective action.</p>

			<h3>Channel Effects &amp; Social Relations Models</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//sml.comm.cornell.edu/people">Dr. Bazarova</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Dr. Yuan</a>] This paper introduces social relations analysis (SRA) and its statistical realizations&mdash;social relations models, as a multilevel framework to study channel effects of information and communication technology on social psychological processes. We summarize major conceptions of such effects in previous research on computer-mediated communication, which has examined relevant processes at group (e.g., team collaboration), dyadic (e.g., relationship development), and individual (e.g., social identification) levels separately. We discuss the connections between these conceptions and five prototypical processes&mdash;social integration, dyadic idiosyncrasy, dyadic coordination, categorical stereotyping, and dispositional stereotyping&mdash;that can be simultaneously captured by SRA through its statistical realizations. We also present an example to illustrate the richness of channel effects through the lens of SRA, along with the key methodological and analytical procedures.</p>

			<h3>Communication Accommodation &amp; Status Development (or Expertise Judgment)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//sml.comm.cornell.edu/people">Dr. Bazarova</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Dr. Yuan</a>] Taking a communication approach to expertise, this study examined emergence of expertise through communication accommodation in 46 four-person face-to-face (FtF) and text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) groups. We found that FtF members with a lower pre-discussion task confidence accommodated to the linguistic styles of those with a higher pre-discussion task confidence. Meanwhile, such a linguistic form of communication accommodation influenced post-discussion expertise judgment in CMC groups such that members who accommodated to others were judged as having less expertise. The communication accommodation also influenced post-discussion expertise judgment in FtF groups after taking into account perceived task-oriented communication and perceived influence. The findings emphasize the important roles of CA and of communication channel in expertise emergence.</p>

			<h3>Social Exchange &amp; Information Sharing (w/ outsider)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.risk.comm.cornell.edu/members">Dr. McComas</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Dr. Yuan</a>] This study addressed how engaging in different forms of information exchange with a group is related to group members’ willingness to share risk information with outsiders. Drawing from social exchange theories, we focused on three unrestricted forms of information exchange: pure-generalized, group-generalized, and productive. We hypothesized that individuals’ intentions to share information with outsiders would be associated positively with engagement in pure- or group-generalized exchange and negatively with productive exchange. The hypotheses were supported with data from a national survey of U.S. growers (<em>N</em> = 452) that examined their information-sharing behaviors with groups inside and outside their local region. The findings have broad implications for understanding information sharing within and across groups.</p>

			<h3>Social Exchange &amp; Information Sharing (w/ insider)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Dr. Yuan</a> &amp; <a href="//www.risk.comm.cornell.edu/members">Dr. McComas</a>] This paper extends our understanding of risk communication related to communal risk and risk information sharing. Building on research from risk communication, organizational behavior, and social psychology, it examines motivations to share information about a communal risk that concerns individual-, relational-, and community-level outcomes. We tested our hypotheses using a national sample of U.S. tomato and potato growers (<em>N</em> = 452) regarding information sharing behaviors about a devastating plant disease that poses a communal, economic risk to agricultural communities. Our findings show that growers were motivated to share information about a communal risk based on (1) individual-oriented concerns for economic costs, (2) relationship-oriented concerns for reciprocation and the information recipient’s trustworthiness, and (3) community-oriented concerns comprising a sense of shared responsibility and community cohesiveness.</p>

			<h3>R Package for Regression Discontinuity Design</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.felixthoemmes.com">Dr. Thoemmes</a> &amp; <a href="//stat.cornell.edu/people/phds/ze-jin">Ze Jin</a>] We are developing a comprehensive yet easy-to-use R package <code>rddapp</code> (with a Shiny interface!) for (1) assumption checking, (2) estimating, (3) visualizing, (4) robustness-inspecting, and (5) power-analyzing regression discontinuity designs (RDD)&ndash;with a lot more other functions. RDD is considered one of the best approaches to causal influence for certain types of &lsquo;natural experiment.&rsquo; While RDD has been widely used by economists and researchers in other fields (e.g., education research), it is still less familiar to communication researchers. However, the rationale behind RDD could be potentially extended to studying many communication phenomena using certain observational data. My collaborations with Dr. Thoemmes also reflect my general interest in causal inference, which is not just a series of methods but a foundation of studying and theorizing human communication.</p>

			<h3>SPSS Plugin for Propensity Score Matching</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.felixthoemmes.com">Dr. Thoemmes</a>] We have developed a SPSS plugin for propensity score matching&mdash;another popular way to adjusting observational data for causal inference. This plugin is, in fact, an easy-to-use wrapper of the R package <code>matchit</code> for the good, old SPSS, with a goal to provide a standardized procedure of propensity score matching. Since the lunch of the initial version by Dr. Thoemmes around 2012 (and I joined at around 2013), this plugin has been downloaded 45,801 times! (last checked at 2017-06-01)</p>
