		<h2>Wang studies communication with respect to human sociality and organizing.</h2>
	</header>
	
	  <p>I have always been interested in social interaction, emergent properties/structures, and social psychology. Amid this general interest, human communication has held a special fascination for me: Whether and how communication, with its prevalent, fluid, mostly automatic, and often overlooked dynamics and structures, can serve as a causal agent in different aspects of our social and organizational life?</p><p>My doctoral training touches two basic social processes: solidarity and hierarchy, and I have being studying the corresponding roles of communication.  With my colleagues and mentors at Cornell, I have examined information sharing and social exchange structure in farming communities, interpersonal dynamics and status development in teams, and communicative acts of online &lsquo;crowds&rsquo; in relation to social identity, emotion, and solidarity.</p><p>As a recent project, my dissertation is investigating how interpersonal dynamics of affect, through nonverbal communication, impact status organizing within task-oriented groups. In such groups, individual and collective cognitions, along with the supporting role of communication strategies or technologies, have been the predominant focus by previous research&mdash;but I think communication may be more fundamental, if we look at the flow of affect in interactions.</p><p>To grasp the theoretical richness of communication, I also adopt various quantitative and computational methods. I believe they offer an great access to not only the evolving communication phenomena in contemporary societies, but also scientific understandings of the causality of communication.</p><p>Before graduate school, I was majored in advertising and a part-time layout designer back in China.</p>

			<h3>Communication, &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; &amp; Status Development</h3>
			<p>[<strong>Dissertation Project</strong>] The study investigates status development in collaborative decision-making groups that involve potential status contest. The focus is the following mediation: Visual status signaling leads to physiological stress responses, which in turn affects deference and status development. The goal of this study is to identify an affective mechanism (i.e., stress experience) of status development in task- and collective-oriented groups. Status development in such groups has been predominantly studied from a perspective that emphasizes group processes and judgment of task-specific competence or value to a group. &lsquo;Stress,&rsquo; on the other hand, has been studied in relation to social status in human and primate groups, but not systematically examined in task- and collective-oriented settings that also involve status hierarchy. The present study attempts to address this issue.</p>

			<h3>&lsquo;Group Talk,&rsquo; Emotions, &amp; Self-Organized Solidarity</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//blogs.cornell.edu/margolin/people">Prof. Margolin</a>] The communication logics that spur self-organized collective action are not well-understood. We argue that two evolutionary predispositions—human group-mindedness and social functionalities of discrete emotions—contribute to a phenomenon we call &lsquo;group talk&rsquo; where group identifiers outwardly discuss their group and, by doing so, increase self-organized solidarity. We test this communication logic among professional football fans who are repeatedly exposed to intergroup competition outcomes that, for them, are quasi-randomized. We find that competition outcomes induce differential expressions of emotions in group talk, which stimulate (positivity, anger) or suppress (sadness) further group talk, triggering a self-sustaining tendency over a full week. Implications are discussed regarding group talk’s socio-emotional functionality for self-organization in contemporary collective action.</p>

			<h3>Channel Effects &amp; Social Relations Models</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//sml.comm.cornell.edu/people">Prof. Bazarova</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Prof. Yuan</a>] This paper introduces social relations analysis (SRA) and its statistical realizations&mdash;social relations models, as a multilevel framework to study channel effects of information and communication technology on social psychological processes. We summarize major conceptions of such effects in previous research on computer-mediated communication, which has examined relevant processes at group (e.g., team collaboration), dyadic (e.g., relationship development), and individual (e.g., social identification) levels separately. We discuss the connections between these conceptions and five prototypical processes&mdash;social integration, dyadic idiosyncrasy, dyadic coordination, categorical stereotyping, and dispositional stereotyping&mdash;that can be simultaneously captured by SRA through its statistical realizations. We also present an example to illustrate the richness of channel effects through the lens of SRA, along with the key methodological and analytical procedures.</p>

			<h3>Communication Accommodation &amp; Status Development (or Expertise Judgment)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//sml.comm.cornell.edu/people">Prof. Bazarova</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Prof. Yuan</a>] Taking a communication approach to expertise, this study examined emergence of expertise through communication accommodation in 46 four-person face-to-face (FtF) and text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) groups. We found that FtF members with a lower pre-discussion task confidence accommodated to the linguistic styles of those with a higher pre-discussion task confidence. Meanwhile, such a linguistic form of communication accommodation influenced post-discussion expertise judgment in CMC groups such that members who accommodated to others were judged as having less expertise. The communication accommodation also influenced post-discussion expertise judgment in FtF groups after taking into account perceived task-oriented communication and perceived influence. The findings emphasize the important roles of CA and of communication channel in expertise emergence.</p>

			<h3>Social Exchange &amp; Information Sharing (w/ outsider)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.risk.comm.cornell.edu/members">Prof. McComas</a> &amp; <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Prof. Yuan</a>] This study addressed how engaging in different forms of information exchange with a group is related to group members’ willingness to share risk information with outsiders. Drawing from social exchange theories, we focused on three unrestricted forms of information exchange: pure-generalized, group-generalized, and productive. We hypothesized that individuals’ intentions to share information with outsiders would be associated positively with engagement in pure- or group-generalized exchange and negatively with productive exchange. The hypotheses were supported with data from a national survey of U.S. growers (<em>N</em> = 452) that examined their information-sharing behaviors with groups inside and outside their local region. The findings have broad implications for understanding information sharing within and across groups.</p>

			<h3>Social Exchange &amp; Information Sharing (w/ insider)</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/y-connie-yuan">Prof. Yuan</a> &amp; <a href="//www.risk.comm.cornell.edu/members">Prof. McComas</a>] This paper extends our understanding of risk communication related to communal risk and risk information sharing. Building on research from risk communication, organizational behavior, and social psychology, it examines motivations to share information about a communal risk that concerns individual-, relational-, and community-level outcomes. We tested our hypotheses using a national sample of U.S. tomato and potato growers (<em>N</em> = 452) regarding information sharing behaviors about a devastating plant disease that poses a communal, economic risk to agricultural communities. Our findings show that growers were motivated to share information about a communal risk based on (1) individual-oriented concerns for economic costs, (2) relationship-oriented concerns for reciprocation and the information recipient’s trustworthiness, and (3) community-oriented concerns comprising a sense of shared responsibility and community cohesiveness.</p>

			<h3>R Package for Regression Discontinuity Design</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.felixthoemmes.com">Prof. Thoemmes</a> &amp; <a href="//stat.cornell.edu/people/phds/ze-jin">Ze Jin</a>] We are developing a comprehensive yet easy-to-use R package <code>rddapp</code> (with a Shiny interface!) for (1) assumption checking, (2) estimating, (3) visualizing, (4) robustness-inspecting, and (5) power-analyzing regression discontinuity designs (RDD)&ndash;with a lot more other functions. RDD is considered one of the best approaches to causal influence for certain types of &lsquo;natural experiment.&rsquo; While RDD has been widely used by economists and researchers in other fields (e.g., education research), it is still less familiar to communication researchers. However, the rationale behind RDD could be potentially extended to studying many communication phenomena using certain observational data. My collaborations with Prof. Thoemmes also reflect my general interest in causal inference, which is not just a series of methods but a foundation of studying and theorizing human communication.</p>

			<h3>SPSS Plugin for Propensity Score Matching</h3>
			<p>[w/ <a href="//www.felixthoemmes.com">Prof. Thoemmes</a>] We have developed a SPSS plugin for propensity score matching&mdash;another popular way to adjusting observational data for causal inference. This plugin is, in fact, an easy-to-use wrapper of the R package <code>matchit</code> for the good, old SPSS, with a goal to provide a standardized procedure of propensity score matching. Since the lunch of the initial version by Prof. Thoemmes around 2012 (and I joined at around 2013), this plugin has been downloaded 45,801 times! (last checked at 2017-06-01)</p>
